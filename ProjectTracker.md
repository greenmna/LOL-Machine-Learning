# League of Legends (LOL) Match Outcome Prediction Project

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to **develop a machine learning algorithm** that can **predict what team is likely to win/lose a game**

To do this, we must be able to do the following
1. Select a threshold for what players to use
2. Use these players to look up data from the Riot API
3. Process and engineer features for the model
4. Exploratory data analysis
5. Train the model(s)
6. Test the model(s)
   1. If models fail/are not sufficiently good, adjust features used and repeat steps 5-6
